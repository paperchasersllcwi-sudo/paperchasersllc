    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      Paper Chasers LLC — Wisconsin (Fox Valley Area)
      <span class="pill">Effective: January 27, 2026</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern services provided by Paper Chasers LLC (“Paper Chasers,” “we,” “us”)
      to any client (“you,” “client”). By requesting or accepting services, you agree to these Terms.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      <strong>Plain-English summary:</strong> We do professional support work. Scope must be agreed. Changes require confirmation.
      Payments are due as agreed. We handle information with discretion. We do not provide legal advice and are not a law firm.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Service Area</h2>
    <p>
      We operate in <strong>Wisconsin</strong>, with an emphasis on the <strong>Fox Valley Area</strong>.
      Availability outside the Fox Valley may depend on scheduling, distance, and project scope.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Scope of Work</h2>
    <p>
      Services are provided on a task-based or project-based basis. Scope, deliverables, and timing will be confirmed
      in writing whenever feasible (email/text is acceptable).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Work is limited to the scope expressly agreed.</li>
      <li>No expanded scope will be assumed without confirmation.</li>
      <li>If additional work is requested, we will notify you before proceeding.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. No Legal Advice / Not a Law Firm</h2>
    <p>
      Paper Chasers LLC is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice. We do not represent clients as attorneys.
      Any legal research, document preparation, or support services are administrative in nature and provided only
      where permitted by applicable law. If legal advice is required, consult a licensed attorney.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Scheduling, Timelines, and Client Cooperation</h2>
    <p>
      Timelines depend on scope, complexity, availability, and client responsiveness. You agree to provide accurate information
      and reasonable cooperation. Delays caused by missing information, unavailability, or changes to scope may affect timing.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Fees, Deposits, and Payments</h2>
    <p>
      Fees may be flat-rate, hourly, or per-task depending on the service and urgency. Payment terms will be stated before work begins
      or at the time services are rendered unless otherwise agreed in writing.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deposits:</strong> Certain projects may require a deposit before work begins. If required, it will be stated in writing.</li>
      <li><strong>Balances:</strong> Remaining balances are due upon completion or as otherwise agreed in writing.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Payments may be processed through Square and other approved methods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Cancellations and Rescheduling</h2>
    <p>
      If you need to cancel or reschedule, notify us as soon as possible. For time-reserved work (rush requests, scheduled runs,
      or scheduled service windows), fees may still apply based on time reserved and costs incurred. Any non-refundable or time-reserved
      charges will be disclosed before work begins.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Confidentiality and Disclosures</h2>
    <p>
      We handle client information with discretion and take reasonable steps to maintain confidentiality. However, confidentiality cannot be
      guaranteed where disclosure is required by law, court order, or lawful process.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Deliverables and Records</h2>
    <p>
      Deliverables may include documents, summaries, receipts, status notes, timestamps, or other project materials depending on the service.
      We may retain basic administrative records of services performed for business, compliance, and dispute-resolution purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Client Representations</h2>
    <p>
      You represent that the information you provide is accurate to the best of your knowledge and that your request for services is for lawful purposes.
      We reserve the right to decline work that appears unlawful, unsafe, or outside our scope.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by law, Paper Chasers LLC’s liability for any claim arising out of or relating to services provided
      will be limited to the amount paid for the specific service giving rise to the claim.
    </p>

    <h2>11. No Guarantees</h2>
    <p>
      While we strive for accuracy and quality, outcomes can depend on third parties, client-provided information, and circumstances outside our control.
      We do not guarantee specific outcomes or results.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. The version posted on this website is the current version.
      Changes apply prospectively from the effective date posted.
