    <h2 id="about">About</h2>
    <p>
      Paper Chasers LLC provides practical, professional support for individuals, small businesses,
      and legal professionals. We focus on clear communication, documented follow-through,
      and completing work correctly the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our approach is simple: define the scope, confirm expectations, execute, and deliver.
      If something falls outside the agreed scope, it is flagged early and addressed before
      time or cost overruns occur.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      <strong>Notice:</strong> Paper Chasers LLC is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice.
      Any legal research or document support is administrative in nature and performed only
      where permitted by applicable law. If legal advice is required, consult a licensed attorney.
