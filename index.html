    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Paper Chasers LLC provides practical, professional support for individuals, small businesses,
      and legal professionals. We focus on clear communication, documented follow-through,
      and completing work correctly the first time.

      Our approach is simple: define the scope, confirm expectations, execute, and deliver.
      If something falls outside the agreed scope, it is flagged early and addressed before
      time or cost overruns occur.
